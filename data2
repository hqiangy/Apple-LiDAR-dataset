# Apple LiDAR Pavement Cracks Dataset

## Overview
This dataset contains pavement crack point clouds collected using Apple LiDAR on an Iphone 16 Pro at Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai Campus. The dataset is intended for research on the potential application of Apple LiDAR in pavement crack detection.

## Data Collection Details
- **Device**: Iphone 16 Pro  
- **Software**: SiteScape  
- **Point Cloud Density**: Premium  
- **Point Cloud Size**: Small  
- **File Format**: .ply  
- **Each File Represents**: A single crack  

## Crack Measurement Attributes
- **Measurement Tool**: A vernier caliper with a resolution of **0.01mm** was used to measure crack width and depth.  
- **Crack Type Annotation**: Crack types (**transverse, longitudinal, alligator, and block cracks**) were manually labeled based on visual inspection.  
- **Measurement Variability**: Due to different crack characteristics, some width measurements represent average values.  
- **Weather Conditions**: Data was collected during **light rain**, and the point cloud may include water accumulation in cracks.  
- **Measurement Consistency**: All measurements were conducted by the **same team** to ensure consistency.
